              <h3>Food52</h3>
              <p>
               When it comes to the ‘official version’, so to speak, of food blogging, the culinary magazines are on top. This is literary the case with Food52, which ranks amongst the gods of the social media food show with no less than 2.7m followers on Instagram. Like all the respected magazines out there, Food52 has its “how to” perks – we can assure you, you won’t get enough of it.
   
               Here you can find how you can preserve your favorite type of pumpkin, the latest trends in home design, and a hearty recipe for a cheesy green Shakshuka – all packed into beautiful stories, sufficiently long enough to keep you company over your morning coffee, and delivered to you directly by expert chefs and artistic decorators.
               
               And when you’d have had enough of indulging in the mouth-watering recipes and heart-stealing pictures, Food52 has a shop area prepared for you, also packed with home and kitchen goodies.

              This is a blog for the average person who cares about health and fitness. 
                From interval training to running, kickboxing to Zumba, food journaling and calorie counting, this blog will explore the methods (and madness) of the everyday person trying to get in – and stay in – shape. 
                This is not just about reaching a weight goal by a certain deadline – although we can talk about that. This is not just about training for a big-time event like a marathon – although we will look at that, too.
                This blog is about the daily steps on the road to health and fitness for all of us, whether it began years ago in youth sports – or just in the last five minutes. It’s about going to the gym, or going outside, and getting a good workout. It’s about finding ways to shop, cook and dine in a way that supports a healthier lifestyle.
                A warning: This blog is not written by that perfect, beautiful trainer who bench presses Priuses and never eats Pringles. This blog will be coming from a place of countless Weight Watchers meetings, failed attempts at fad diets and an undiagnosed but certainly real fear of the scale.
                And yet there is always the need, after falling, to get back up and get back to the gym. In other words, keep your Chin Up. Don’t get down and stay down. Keep fighting.After years of covering the best professional, collegiate and prep school athletes as a sports writer, I wanted a fitness blog for the rest of us.

                So, if you’ve ever sought a bike ride to clear your head…

                Or thrilled in the delight of finishing your first 5K ahead of the street sweepers…

                If you’ve ever gone to the gym instead of MC DONALDS

                Or gone to the gym after your trip to MC DONALDS

                If you’ve ever been so sore after working your triceps that it hurt to shampoo the next day…Or thought burpee was a brand of garden seed and planks were for pirates…Then I invite you to come back here and check out the blog, post your comments and suggestions and share your struggles and triumphs. Or, just laugh at and make fun of mine.
